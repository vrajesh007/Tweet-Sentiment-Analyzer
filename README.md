# Tweet-Sentiment-Analyzer
The application is designed to analyze social-media sentiment data to uncover users’ emotions and opinions.


Description:
• In recent years, social-networking platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have attracted massive numbers of users. These platforms are commonly used for sharing emotions, beliefs, and opinions about events, places, and public figures.

• As social media usage has grown, so has the practice of extracting and analyzing this data for purposes such as election forecasting, education, business intelligence, communication, and marketing.

• Sentiment and predictive accuracy can be improved through behavioral analysis of social-network data. For example, to understand the opinions surrounding leaders of two major political parties in India, data was collected from their public Twitter profiles. Using the Opinion Lexicon, tweets were classified into positive, neutral, and negative categories. The results showed that understanding public sentiment can help political parties refine their strategies.

• Similarly, a keyword-based dataset was created for the 2013 Pakistan elections, focusing on tweets mentioning political parties and well-known political figures. This dataset was evaluated using both supervised and unsupervised machine-learning methods, including the Rainbow tool, Print, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naïve Bayes algorithms.

• Twitter offers verified accounts for politicians, which is often not the case on platforms like Facebook or Instagram. Its 280-character limit encourages users to express their views concisely, making it a valuable platform for sentiment and opinion mining. Research has shown that Twitter provides deeper insights into public perception compared to traditional data-collection methods.

• In this project, I also introduce an algorithm designed to extract emotional signals from large-scale tweet data for sentiment analysis. To identify influential social communities, a new method was implemented that assigns a metric value to each user’s emotionally-charged posts. The project includes comprehensive election-related sentiment analysis using multiple sentiment-analysis tools.
